        "A 100% organic soil-rejuvenation technology that boosts crop yield, improves soil fertility, and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.",
      description:
        "Multiplier is a modern organic technology that initiates a natural system through which crops receive free nutrition by restoring soil fertility. It also transforms poor and barren land into cultivable farmland by increasing the population of beneficial microbes and earthworms in the soil. Multiplier technology boosts crop production by up to 50% in the first year, and with continued use, yields can increase up to threefold within seven years. This technique eliminates crop malnutrition, protects plants from diseases and pests, and enhances both the quantity and quality of leaves, flowers, and fruits. By increasing the oxygen content in the soil, Multiplier reduces the presence of harmful viruses and ensures the return of earthworms providing farmers with free earthworm compost worth ₹4 to ₹10 lakhs every year. As a result of this technology, the dependence on chemical fertilisers and pesticides gradually diminishes, making pure, natural, and zero-budget farming a practical reality. Multiplier is neither a fertilizer nor a pesticide — it is the only modern soil-rejuvenation technology that empowers every farmer to become self-reliant.",

        "A 100% organic soil-rejuvenation technology that boosts crop yield, improves soil fertility, and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.",
      description:
        "Multiplier is a modern organic technology that initiates a natural system through which crops receive free nutrition by restoring soil fertility. It also transforms poor and barren land into cultivable farmland by increasing the population of beneficial microbes and earthworms in the soil. Multiplier technology boosts crop production by up to 50% in the first year, and with continued use, yields can increase up to threefold within seven years. This technique eliminates crop malnutrition, protects plants from diseases and pests, and enhances both the quantity and quality of leaves, flowers, and fruits. By increasing the oxygen content in the soil, Multiplier reduces the presence of harmful viruses and ensures the return of earthworms providing farmers with free earthworm compost worth ₹4 to ₹10 lakhs every year. As a result of this technology, the dependence on chemical fertilisers and pesticides gradually diminishes, making pure, natural, and zero-budget farming a practical reality. Multiplier is neither a fertilizer nor a pesticide — it is the only modern soil-rejuvenation technology that empowers every farmer to become self-reliant.",
